# STATE-LOG — FCG Website

## 2026-09-08 (session 4) — Header lockup renamed, on two lines

### What changed

The header brand lockup reads **Open Developer Platform** on every page, on two lines: `OPEN` above
`DEVELOPER PLATFORM`. The brand link's `aria-label` follows the new name.

One extra word does not fit on one line. The header already sat flush against the 1200px content
column with zero slack, so a third word would have pushed it past the column again and scrolled the
document sideways below ~1230px. Breaking after the qualifier keeps `DEVELOPER PLATFORM` as the
longest line, so the brand column keeps its exact width and the header still aligns from 1180px up.

### Decisions

- **One text node per line, not a CSS wrap.** Natural wrapping at any width that fits
  `DEVELOPER PLATFORM` breaks as `OPEN DEVELOPER` / `PLATFORM`, which splits the noun phrase. An
  explicit `<br>` gives the reading order the label wants.
- **Each locale sets its own break.** `开放平台` / `開放平台` already carries "open", so a literal
  translation of `Open` would have read "Open Open Platform". The first line takes `开发者` /
  `開發者` instead, so Chinese reads Developer / Open Platform on two lines.
- `.brand-div` grew from 20px to 27px so the rule spans a two-line label rather than half of it.
- Mobile is unchanged: `.brand-div` and `.brand-sub` are already hidden under 640px.

### Left alone deliberately

The request was the header. Three other places still carry the old name, and changing them is a
naming decision rather than a layout one:

- The homepage hero `h1`: `FCG Developer<br>Platform`.
- Every page `<title>`: `… — FCG Developer Platform` (index.html's own title is already
  `Open Developer Platform`, so the set is already inconsistent).
- The footer brand line: "The FCG Developer Platform: standardised APIs and flexible SDKs…".

### Verified

`verify-pages.js`: 0 failing checks out of 48, in each of the three locales. Header sits flush to the
content column at 1440 / 1366 / 1280 / 1180 / 1100 / 1024, no document overflow at any of them.
Live on the production URL after the push of `0a4d5be`: the English header serves
`Open<br>Developer Platform` and zh-Hant serves `開發者<br>開放平台`, deployment READY from
`source: git` five seconds after the push.

### Learnings

**Problem.** Add a word to a header lockup that had no horizontal room left, without breaking the
Chinese editions.

**Approach.** Check the constraint before the copy: the header's right edge was already flush with
the content column, so this was a layout problem wearing a copy request. Break the label into two
lines at the qualifier, then confirm the longest line is unchanged — that is what keeps the column
width, and therefore the alignment, intact. Verify at every breakpoint, not just the design width.

**Judgment calls — what was NOT done, and why.**
- Did not let CSS choose the break. The only widths that fit `DEVELOPER PLATFORM` also fit
  `OPEN DEVELOPER`, so natural wrapping splits the noun phrase every time.
- Did not translate `Open` literally. Chinese already says "open platform"; a literal line would
  have doubled the word.
- Did not shrink the nav type further to fit one line. It is already at 13px, down from 13.5px
  earlier today, and a fourth reduction would be paying for a line break with legibility.
- Did not rename the hero h1, the page titles or the footer line. The ask was the header, and those
  are a naming call for Crystal.

**Reusable rule.** When a copy change lands in fixed chrome, measure the chrome first. If the
element is already flush to its column, the change is a layout task, and the test of a two-line fix
is whether the longest line stayed the same.

## 2026-09-08 (session 3) — The marketing globe, and the portal deployed

### What changed

**Coverage Map runs the marketing site's Cobe globe.** The hand-drawn SVG wireframe is gone.
`pages_content.py` reads the inlined Cobe IIFE out of the repo-root
[index.html](index.html) at build time rather than copying it, so the portal and fcg.com cannot
drift. Same fourteen cities, same `#F97316` markers, configured for the portal's light palette
(`dark:0`, `--card` glow, `mapBrightness:2`).

**Deployed to production** — [fcg-open-developer-platform.vercel.app](https://fcg-open-developer-platform.vercel.app).
All 48 pages live, both Chinese locales included.

### Decisions

- **Route arcs dropped.** On the marketing site they are labelled flight routes (`BKK → LHR`),
  which say nothing about hotel coverage; unlabelled they would be pure decoration.
- **Labels on the eight larger markers only**, positioned on whichever side of the sphere the point
  sits so no per-city offsets are needed, with a front-most-first collision pass. The marketing
  site's fourteen hand-tuned labels turn into a smudge at 460px.
- **Label threshold raised to `z > 0.32`.** At the marketing site's 0.18 a label appears while still
  3px blurred and reads as a smear against the panel edge.
- **`.vercelignore` added** to the variant folder. Without it a static deploy would serve
  `build-pages.py`, `pages_content.py` and the translation tables off the public URL.
- **Account map corrected.** `~/.claude/project-accounts.md` had no row for this project.

### The hosting picture, established by API

Two Vercel projects on work team `team_SyKixqrcZUCIGFNYQC13rwVl`:

- `fcg-website` (`prj_bIBO2PVjRM052GwQXYZN0ZxoPCWB`) — Git-connected to `cwong-acmy/fcg-website`,
  production branch `main`.
- `fcg-open-developer-platform` (`prj_dhe1toSi7yeTJOKGuUsOwKWqhUuG`) — **no Git connection at all.**
  CLI-deployed only. Its previous and only deployment was `source: cli` at 13:59 on 8 September,
  which is why the live URL showed the pre-mega nav and 404'd on the four new pages while the
  branch had been pushed for hours. **Pushing to GitHub does not update this URL.**

### Verified against the real destination

On `https://fcg-open-developer-platform.vercel.app`, not localhost: `/`, `/sandbox.html`,
`/request-trace.html`, `/coverage-map.html`, `/hotel-mapping.html`, `/zh-Hant/coverage-map.html`
and `/zh-Hans/sandbox.html` all return 200. `/build-pages.py`, `/pages_content.py` and `/i18n.py`
return 404, so the ignore file holds. The live coverage page reports `globeOpacity: 1` with labels
rendering and no page errors. Deployment `dpl_9kUm1CQCoGSvrqgJHm2nBeiGc18P`, from commit `6d819bd`.

`verify-pages.js` locally: 0 failing checks out of 48, in each of the three locales.

### Git connection (added same session)

`fcg-open-developer-platform` is now connected to `cwong-acmy/fcg-website`, root directory
`open-portal-redesign/variant-b-impeccable`, **production branch `portal-redesign-direction-b`** —
not `main`, because `main` has no `open-portal-redesign/` directory at all (it is at
`6999dd1 Checkpoint: Full Website V8`, the marketing site only). A production build from `main`
would have had no root directory to build.

Two API notes worth keeping. `PATCH /v9/projects/{id}` rejects both `link` and `productionBranch`
as unknown properties; the production branch is set by **`PATCH /v1/projects/{id}/branch`** with
`{"branch": "..."}`. And `POST /v9/projects/{id}/link` accepts a `productionBranch` field but
silently ignores it — it returned `main` after being asked for the branch.

`vercel.json` was added alongside `.vercelignore`: the ignore file only governs what the CLI
uploads, so once the project builds from GitHub the Python generator needed a route-level 404 too.

**When this branch merges to `main`, the production branch setting must move with it**, or the live
URL silently freezes at the last commit to the old branch.

Proven end to end: the push of `54bd2d8` at 07:20:48Z produced a `source: git` production deployment
at 07:20:52Z, branch `portal-redesign-direction-b`, state READY. On the live URL afterwards, all seven
sampled pages return 200 across the three locales, and `/build-pages.py`, `/pages_content.py`,
`/i18n_zh_hans.py`, `/__pycache__/...` and `/vercel.json` all return 404.

### Blockers / next actions

- `open-portal-redesign/shots/b-pages` still holds 45MB of regenerated PNGs, uncommitted.

### Learnings

**Problem.** "Use the globe from the FCG website" on a page in a sibling build, and work out why a
Vercel URL that certainly exists was serving a version from before the day's work.

**Approach.** For the globe: find the real implementation rather than reproducing its look — it was
an inlined Cobe IIFE in the marketing `index.html`. Read it at build time so there is one copy, and
re-tune only what the new context changes (palette, size, label density). For the URL: ask the
provider API which project serves it, then read `link` and the deployment `source` rather than
assuming a Git connection exists.

**Judgment calls — what was NOT done, and why.**
- Did not copy the 11.6KB Cobe build into `pages_content.py`. A second copy drifts the first time
  either file is touched; reading it keeps one source and the assert fails loudly if it moves.
- Did not keep the route arcs, and did not relabel them as something coverage-related. Both would
  have been decoration dressed as data.
- Did not carry over the marketing globe's `HOTELS: 4.3M+` overlay. It is a marketing figure, not a
  portal fact, and this page deliberately carries no counts.
- Did not deploy from the repo root. Root `.vercel/` points at `fcg-website`, a different project;
  deploying from there would have pushed the marketing site into the portal's URL.
- Did not assume the missing pages meant a failed deploy. The deployment was `READY` — it was simply
  older than the work, which the API's `created` timestamp settles in one call.

**Reusable rule.** When asked to reuse a component from a sibling surface, import the implementation
at build time rather than reproducing the appearance. And when a live URL looks stale, read the
project's `link` and its latest deployment's `source` before touching anything: "pushed to GitHub"
and "deployed" are the same sentence only when a Git connection exists.

## 2026-09-08 (session 2) — The four Products pages, built and design-checked

### What changed

**Sandbox, Request Trace, Coverage Map and Hotel Mapping are real pages.** The Products mega menu's four
placeholder destinations now point at
[sandbox](open-portal-redesign/variant-b-impeccable/sandbox.html),
[request-trace](open-portal-redesign/variant-b-impeccable/request-trace.html),
[coverage-map](open-portal-redesign/variant-b-impeccable/coverage-map.html) and
[hotel-mapping](open-portal-redesign/variant-b-impeccable/hotel-mapping.html), authored in
[pages_content.py](open-portal-redesign/variant-b-impeccable/pages_content.py) and built in all three
locales. The portal is 16 pages × 3 locales = 48.

Content came from the console captures in
[reference/console-dev](open-portal-redesign/reference/console-dev) — the four screenshots plus
`_text.json` — rewritten into FCG's declarative voice in British English. Nothing was invented: where the
console shows a control but not its data (batch statuses, coverage counts), the page describes what the
control reports instead of showing a fabricated number.

**Coverage Map carries the one new component**: an orthographic wireframe globe, tilt 18°, centred on
60°E, with hidden-line removal, plotted from real city coordinates and sized by the console's own legend
bands. Geometry is generated once and baked in, not computed at build time.

**Nav and chrome:** the Products trigger now takes an active state on the four menu-only pages, the
footer picks all four up, and `verify-pages.js` covers them.

### Decisions

- **Extension, not a new visual world.** Impeccable's `context.mjs` asked for `init`/PRODUCT.md first;
  skipped deliberately. `open-portal-redesign/DESIGN-SYSTEM.md` plus the twelve built pages already are
  the authority, and interviewing for product truth would have re-derived what the repo states.
- **No fabricated data anywhere.** Request Trace shows an illustrative table with `{trace_id}`-style
  placeholders and a `.disclaim`, which is the pattern index.html already uses. Hotel Mapping's batch
  history became a column-definition list instead of a second placeholder table — repeating the device
  twice would have read as filler.
- **Grouped IA taken from the console.** Two rails: App Management / Sandbox / Request Trace (the
  console's "Integration & Debugging") and Coverage Map / Hotel Mapping (its "Hotel Catalog").
- **Nine filters two-up.** A nine-row full-width definition list read as a second essay directly under a
  six-row one; the two-column variant reads as a lookup.

### Fixed along the way

- **`i18n.py` dropped the slash from self-closing tags.** Harmless for `<br/>`, fatal for SVG: `<circle
  .../>` came out as `<circle ...>`, so every shape after it nested inside a shape and the globe rendered
  as an empty ring in both Chinese locales. Fixed in `handle_startendtag`; the empty-table round-trip is
  still byte-identical across all 16 English pages.
- **The header overflowed the 1200px content column.** Pre-existing: it sat 51px past the column at every
  width and scrolled the document sideways below ~1180px. The sixth nav pill made it worse. Header
  metrics tightened (pill padding, gaps, 13px nav type) so it aligns exactly from 1180px up, and the
  drawer now takes over below 1180 instead of the header spilling.
- Bare `<code>` in a table cell or flow strip fell back to the browser's monospace rather than `--mono`.

### Verified

`verify-pages.js` across all three locales: **0 failing checks out of 48 per locale**, no JS errors, at
1280 / 768 / 375. Full-page captures reviewed at 1440 and 390 for all four pages plus zh-Hant. No dead
internal links across all 48 pages. Build reports both Chinese locales fully translated (430 new strings).

### Blockers / next actions

- The `small-orange` advisories the verifier prints are the documented `--accent-ink` contrast trade-off
  Crystal chose, not regressions.
- Orphan `__pycache__` entries exist for `build-console.py`, `console_content.py`, `console_nav.py` and
  `build_console_globe.py` whose sources are not in the tree. Left alone — worth asking about.

### Learnings

**Problem.** Add four pages to a twelve-page generated portal so they read as native to it, using a real
console as the source of truth, without inventing product facts.

**Approach.** Read the incumbent's own design spec and one representative page before writing anything,
then author only in the vocabulary that already exists (band, cards, steps, tbl, chips, note, rail) and
add exactly one new component. Take content from the console captures; where the capture shows a control
with no data, describe the control. Let the build's copy-rule gates and `verify-pages.js` be the checker
rather than self-assessment.

**Judgment calls — what was NOT done, and why.**
- Did not run Impeccable's `init` gate. A documented design system and twelve shipped pages already carry
  more product truth than an interview would have produced, and the skill's own routing allows extension
  on the incumbent.
- Did not fabricate metric values to fill the console's stat strips. All-zero counters look broken and
  invented ones are worse; naming what each counter reports keeps the page honest and still useful.
- Did not build a geographically accurate coverage map. Real per-region counts do not exist on the
  portal, so the globe is labelled illustrative and plots city coordinates for shape, not for claims.
- Did not add a second placeholder table on Hotel Mapping, and did not create stub pages for controls
  that need authentication.
- Did not fix the header overflow by shrinking only the new element. The defect predated the mega menu
  and needed the whole header re-fitted to the column.

**Reusable rule.** When extending a generated site, the incumbent's spec plus one representative page is
the brief; add at most one new component and let the project's own build gates and verifier decide when
it is done. And when a parser rewrites markup, test it against SVG — HTML void-element assumptions break
silently in foreign content, and the failure is invisible in the source locale.

## 2026-09-08 — Products mega menu in the Direction B nav

### What changed

**A `Products` mega menu** in the portal's pill nav, from a screenshot Crystal supplied: three columns
(Start / Build / Operate) with nine icon-and-description links. Added to
[build-pages.py](open-portal-redesign/variant-b-impeccable/build-pages.py) as a `MEGA` table, so all
twelve pages in all three locales get it from one definition. `Home` left the top-level nav (the logo
still links home) and moved into the mobile drawer under a `More` group, matching the screenshot.

CSS and the ~20 lines of behaviour went into
[index.html](open-portal-redesign/variant-b-impeccable/index.html), the shell donor, so they propagate
on the next build. Click to toggle, click-away and Escape to close, focus returns to the trigger.
17 new strings added to both Chinese tables; build reports fully translated.

### Decisions

- **Existing tokens only, no new icon.** The panel is `--hair` borders, `--shell` hover, `.micro`
  eyebrows, 999px pills, Inter — the same grammar as the rest of the header. The chevron is the shared
  `solar:arrow-right-linear` rotated 90°, so the menu adds nothing to the icon payload. Every mega icon
  is one already used elsewhere in the build, so no unverified Iconify name can silently render blank.
- **No stub pages for the four console surfaces that do not exist.** Sandbox, Request Trace, Coverage Map
  and Hotel Mapping point at the nearest real surface (`index.html#start-integration`,
  `api-docs-errors.html`, `index.html#network`, `api-docs-hotel-process.html`). Empty stubs would look
  like shipped pages in a prototype that is being reviewed for direction.
- **Click, not hover, to open.** Hover intent needs timers and a safe triangle; the click toggle is
  keyboard- and touch-correct with no extra state.
- **Mobile drawer repeats the mega, then adds whatever top-level links it misses.** The `seen` set is
  computed from hrefs, so the drawer cannot drift from the panel when `MEGA` or `NAV` changes.

### Verified

Local server, en and zh-Hant at 1440×900 and 375×812: panel renders as designed, toggle / click-away /
Escape all correct, drawer groups render, Chinese copy fits the columns. Build: 36 pages, both locales
fully translated.

### Blockers / next actions

- Crystal to confirm the four placeholder destinations, or ask for real stub pages.
- Not committed, not deployed — working tree only, on `portal-redesign-direction-b`.

### Learnings

**Problem.** Add a mega menu to a portal whose twelve pages are generated from one donor file, without
letting the nav drift between pages or locales.

**Approach.** Put the content in one Python table and derive three consumers from it — the desktop panel,
the mobile drawer, and the drawer's "everything the panel missed" list via a set of hrefs. Put CSS and JS
in the donor `index.html`, never in a generated page. Add the English strings, run the build, and let its
hard-fail on untranslated strings enumerate exactly what the Chinese tables need.

**Judgment calls — what was NOT done, and why.**
- Did not invent Iconify names. Every icon was grepped out of the existing pages first; a wrong Solar name
  renders as blank space with no error, which a screenshot review would miss.
- Did not create stub pages for the four missing console surfaces. In a direction review, a stub reads as
  a shipped page and invites feedback on work that does not exist.
- Did not add hover-to-open. It needs open/close timers and a safe-triangle to not fight the pointer, for
  a nav that already works from click, keyboard and touch.
- Did not hand-translate before building. The builder's missing-string report is the authoritative list;
  guessing it produces both gaps and dead keys.

**Reusable rule.** In a generator with a donor file, new chrome goes in exactly two places — one data table
for content, the donor for CSS and behaviour. Let the build's own failure mode enumerate the follow-up work
instead of predicting it.

## 2026-09-07 (session 2) — Simplified and Traditional Chinese, and a design-system spec

### What changed

**36 pages now: English, Simplified Chinese and Traditional Chinese**, twelve each, at
[variant-b-impeccable/](open-portal-redesign/variant-b-impeccable) with `zh-Hans/` and `zh-Hant/`
subdirectories. The language control is real cross-locale links, wired correctly in all three
directions, with the current locale marked `aria-current="page"`.

**Only copy changes between locales, never layout** — enforced by construction, not by discipline.
[i18n.py](open-portal-redesign/variant-b-impeccable/i18n.py) parses the built English page and swaps
**text nodes and four translatable attributes only** (`placeholder`, `aria-label`, `title`, `content`).
CSS, tokens, classes and markup are byte-identical across locales because nothing else is touched.

**A design-system spec** → [DESIGN-SYSTEM.md](open-portal-redesign/DESIGN-SYSTEM.md). Written to be
followed cold for a new page or an app screen: tokens, the accent law, type scale, the enforced copy
rules, every component with real CSS, the motion rules, the layout traps that shipped as bugs in this
build, the accessibility floor, and a section on what changes when applying this to app UI rather than
marketing pages.

### Decisions

- **Translate the built HTML, not the content source.** Duplicating `pages_content.py` per locale would
  have tripled 1,200 lines of structure and let the design drift silently between languages. Swapping
  text nodes makes design drift impossible.
- **Proved the round-trip is lossless before authoring a single translation.** Translating with an empty
  table must reproduce the input byte-for-byte. It did not at first: Python's `HTMLParser` lowercases
  attribute names, so `viewBox` became `viewbox` and the inlined wordmark stopped rendering. Fixed with
  a small camelCase restore map, and losslessness is now asserted on every build — a new camelCase SVG
  attribute fails the build rather than silently breaking a logo.
- **Traditional Chinese is written for Taiwan/Hong Kong, not converted.** No converter was installed and
  installing one needs approval, but hand-authoring was the better answer anyway: the regional IT and
  travel vocabulary differs, so a glyph conversion produces mainland phrasing in Traditional characters.
  介面 not 接口, 資料 not 數據, 伺服器 not 服務器, 金鑰 not 密鑰, 簽章 not 簽名, 權杖 not 令牌,
  回呼 not 回調, 飯店 not 酒店, 開票 not 出票, 票價 not 運價, 登入 not 登錄, 主控台 not 控制台,
  使用者名稱 not 用戶名, 電子郵件 not 郵箱, 原始碼 not 源碼, 簽核 not 審批, 商旅管理公司 not 差旅管理公司.
- **Nothing is silently left in English.** The build reports every string with no table entry and exits
  non-zero. Both tables hold 606 entries with identical key sets and zero untranslated strings.
- **Product names, endpoint paths, error codes, field names and partner lockups stay as-is** in every
  locale. Pattern-matched (a leading `/`, an `MCP001`-shaped code, a camelCase identifier, an install
  command) rather than listed one by one.

### Also in this session, before the Chinese work

- **The orange pass** Crystal asked for, against three screenshots of the marketing site's own treatment:
  orange eyebrow labels, an orange second clause on a headline, an orange lede lead-in, a tinted status
  chip, orange mono card labels, one filled orange circular arrow on tertiary links. Buttons and panels
  stay ink. Small orange text resolves through `--accent-ink`, so switching to the AA-passing `#C2410C`
  is one value.
- **Three copy rules, each enforced by the build and proved by deliberately breaking it:** an orange
  `<em>` clause must follow a comma; an `<h1>` is a title and never ends in a full stop; one orange
  emphasis per block. The orange clause is `display:block`, so a comma never orphans a word.
- **A motion pass** on Emil Kowalski's framework — press feedback on every pressable, every hover gated
  behind `(hover:hover) and (pointer:fine)`, custom curves, 160ms hover, 60ms stagger, layout properties
  moved onto `transform`, the drawer transitioning with `allow-discrete` plus `@starting-style`, and
  reduced-motion keeping opacity and colour rather than nuking every transition.
- **Chips audited against the page.** Seven band chips removed for restating the heading or lede directly
  below them; eight remain. Chips ride the eyebrow line, never the CTA row.
- **Mobile fixes:** the tab rail now wraps instead of scrolling (a scroller hid options behind an edge),
  buttons size to content with the label flush left, the drawer's CTA pill renders correctly, Login is a
  full-width button there with Register kept in the header, and the language control is a full-width
  three-way segmented row.

### Verified

- `verify-pages.js` — 12 pages × 1280 and 375, per locale. **English 24/24, zh-Hans 24/24, zh-Hant 24/24**,
  no JS errors. It takes an optional locale argument: `node verify-pages.js zh-Hans`.
- `verify-motion.js` — **12/12**, no `transition:all`, no `scale(0)` entry, no `ease-in` on UI, no UI
  transition over 300ms, no layout property animated, `:active` on every pressable, every hover gated.
- Static: CSS token block and all `class` attributes byte-identical across the three locales; every
  internal link resolves in every locale; the language switcher's nine cross-locale hrefs are correct.

### Still open

- **Nothing is deployed.** The live marketing site is served from OneDrive `07 Website` on nginx, not
  this repo and not Vercel. The portal redesign has no deployment target agreed.
- **The AA call on small orange text** is Crystal's, reversible in one token.
- **Image generation still blocked** — both Google AI Studio keys return `429 free_tier limit 0`;
  Higgsfield needs an interactive `hf auth login`. Brand-kit raster boards unbuilt, prompts stored.
- **Six duplicate full-tree folders** remain untracked junk needing Crystal's approval to delete, along
  with `.vercel/` and `.claude/`.
- **All of this is on branch `portal-redesign-direction-b`**, not `main`, and is not pushed.

### Learnings

**Problem.** Ship three language editions of a twelve-page site without the design drifting between
them, while the brief kept changing.

**Approach.** Separate the two things that were being conflated: structure and copy. Generate the page
once, then swap only its text nodes — so "the design is identical across locales" stops being a promise
and becomes a property of the pipeline. Before authoring 1,352 translations, prove the swap is a no-op
when the table is empty. Then drive the untranslated-string count to zero and let the build fail if it
is ever non-zero.

**Judgment calls — what was NOT done, and why.**
- Did not duplicate the content module per locale. Three copies of the structure is three places for the
  design to diverge, and the divergence would be invisible until someone opened two languages side by side.
- Did not author a single translation until the identity round-trip was byte-for-byte clean. It was not,
  and the failure was silent: a lowercased `viewBox` breaks the logo without any error.
- Did not install a Simplified-to-Traditional converter, and would not have used one if it were present.
  It solves the glyphs and leaves the vocabulary wrong for the audience.
- Did not translate product names, endpoint paths, error codes or API field names, and matched them by
  shape rather than listing them, so a new endpoint does not need a table entry.
- Did not accept the horizontal-scroll check as proof of no clipping — `body{overflow-x:hidden}` turns
  overflow into silent truncation, which is exactly how the tab rail shipped cut off.
- Did not fix visual bugs from the screenshot alone. Reading the computed style named the colliding class
  (`.path`) in one query; measuring the boxes showed a `min-height` was landing on the wrong element.

**Reusable rule.** When one artefact must exist in several variants, make the variance a pipeline
property rather than a copy: generate once, transform narrowly, and assert the transform is a no-op on
empty input before trusting it with real content. And turn each accepted rule into a build assertion the
moment it is agreed, then break it once to prove it fires.

## 2026-09-07 (later) — Direction B built out to 12 pages, then an orange pass

### What changed

**Built the eleven remaining portal pages in Direction B**, plus the homepage, at
[open-portal-redesign/variant-b-impeccable/](open-portal-redesign/variant-b-impeccable): app management,
G-Link docs (overview, integration flow, API reference), F-Link docs, error codes, SDK, Skills,
AI Assistant, login, register.

**One shell source.** [build-pages.py](open-portal-redesign/variant-b-impeccable/build-pages.py) lifts the
head, token block and behaviour script verbatim out of `index.html` and generates nav and footer from one
list, writing them back into `index.html` too. Tokens are byte-identical across all twelve files, checked.
Page content is in [pages_content.py](open-portal-redesign/variant-b-impeccable/pages_content.py).

**Content came off the live portal**, read on 7 September 2026: endpoint paths, methods, SDK versions and
install commands, error codes, rate limits. Nothing invented; copy rewritten into FCG's declarative voice
in British English.

**Then Crystal asked for more orange**, against three screenshots of the marketing site's own treatment.
Applied: orange eyebrow labels, an orange second clause on a headline, an orange lead-in phrase on a lede,
a tinted status chip (orange dot + orange label on a pale orange pill), orange mono card labels, and one
filled orange circular arrow on tertiary links. Buttons and panels stay ink.

### Decisions

- **Small orange text is now intended, and sits behind one token.** `--accent-ink` carries every orange
  label under 18px. `#F97316` on white is 2.80:1 and fails AA, which is what the earlier open question was
  about; Crystal chose to match the marketing site. Switching that single token to `#C2410C` (4.6:1) makes
  every small orange label pass without touching anything else. The required-field asterisk on the auth
  forms is ink, not orange, because it is the only visual marker of a required field.
- **Three copy rules, each enforced by the build rather than remembered.** `build-pages.py` refuses to
  build if any of them break, and each was tested by deliberately breaking it:
  1. An orange `<em>` clause must follow a comma. A headline with no comma stays entirely ink.
  2. An `<h1>` is a page title and never ends in a full stop. Section headings are sentences and keep theirs.
  3. One orange emphasis per block: if a heading carries an orange clause, its lede does not also get an
     orange lead-in.
- **The orange clause is block-level**, so a comma can never leave an orphan word at the end of the ink line.
- **Chips must add information the page does not already carry.** Seven band chips were removed for
  restating the heading or lede immediately below them. Eight remain: the Sandbox/Production ready badges on
  the Skills cards (the live portal's own treatment), `Online` on the AI Assistant, `New` on Skills. Chips
  ride the eyebrow line, never the CTA row.
- **Mobile buttons size to content with the label flush left.** Full-bleed pills read as banners on a phone
  and centre their label away from the text column. The form submit stays full width, as forms conventionally do.
- **Header keeps Register; the drawer carries Login as a full-width button** and a three-way
  ENG / 简体 / 繁體 control as a segmented row.
- **Did not extend the chooser.** Its job (pick a direction) is done, and its base64 `srcdoc` embedding
  would break the new cross-page links.

### Bugs found and fixed, all by measuring rather than reading code

- **`td class="path"` collided with the homepage's unscoped `.path` closing card** (`border-radius:24px`,
  `padding:40px 38px`, `display:flex`), rendering every path cell as an overflowing rounded panel. Table cell
  classes now carry a `t-` prefix. A sweep for classes styled in both CSS blocks showed `.path` was the only
  genuine collision; the rest are scoped or deliberate shared components.
- **The tab rail was clipped, not scrolling, below about 585px.** `.band-foot` sizes to content in a column
  flex container and `min-width:auto` stopped it shrinking, so `max-width:100%` on the rail never bit.
  `body{overflow-x:hidden}` meant no document scrollbar appeared and the horizontal-scroll check passed while
  content was silently cut off.
- **The donor script crashed on the auth pages** — the reduced header has no burger, and the unguarded
  `addEventListener` also killed the scroll-reveal observer on those two pages.
- **`.mnav a` was unscoped**, so `display:block` plus vertical padding flattened the drawer's CTA pills and
  pushed their labels outside. Now `.mnav ul a`.
- **`code.inl` was scoped to `.docs-main`**, so instances in chat bubbles and section ledes fell back to the
  browser's default monospace.
- **`min-height` for card-row alignment was hitting `.card-k`** (also a `<p>`), inflating the eyebrow and
  never touching the description.
- **The docs column had a flat 26px between every sibling**, giving a heading the same weight as a paragraph
  break. Now has real rhythm: open above a heading, tight beneath it.
- **Nav `<h4>` labels and the auth aside's `<h2>` sat before the `<h1>`** in the heading outline. They are
  navigation labels, not document headings, so they became `<p>` with `aria-labelledby` on a `<nav>`.

### Verified

[verify-pages.js](open-portal-redesign/verify-pages.js) attaches to Chrome for Testing on `:9222`, loads all
twelve pages at 1280 and 375, forces the reveal animations to their end state so full-page captures are not
blank, and asserts: no console or page errors, no horizontal scroll, nothing clipped by its `.wrap`, the
accent never filling anything at button scale, Inter throughout, one `h1` per page with no heading skips, no
dead `href="#"`, no table cell inheriting panel styling, card meta rows aligned within a visual row, and
`--accent-ink` holding an approved value. **24 / 24 pass, no JS errors.** Screenshots in
[shots/b-pages/](open-portal-redesign/shots/b-pages).

Static checks alongside it: every internal link resolves, and the `:root` token block plus the nav and footer
markup are byte-identical across all twelve files.

### Still open

- **Nothing is deployed.** The live marketing site is served from OneDrive `07 Website` on nginx, not this
  repo and not Vercel, so nothing here changes anything live. The portal redesign has no deployment target
  agreed yet.
- **The AA call on small orange text** is Crystal's, and reversible in one token if she wants `#C2410C`.
- **Image generation still blocked** — both Google AI Studio keys return `429 free_tier limit 0`; Higgsfield
  needs an interactive `hf auth login` from Crystal. Brand-kit raster boards remain unbuilt, prompts stored.
- **Six duplicate full-tree folders** (`about/`, `whitelabel/`, `atlas/`, `agreeease/`,
  `corporate-booking-tool/`, `advisory-implementation/`) are untracked junk from an old copy operation.
  Deleting them needs Crystal's approval. `.vercel/` and `.claude/` also left untracked.
- **This work is on branch `portal-redesign-direction-b`**, not `main`, and is not pushed.

### Learnings

**Problem.** Build eleven pages that must match one existing page exactly, then restyle all twelve to a
moving brief, without drift.

**Approach.** Make the existing page the shell donor rather than a thing to copy: lift its head, token block
and script verbatim at build time and generate nav and footer from one list, writing them back into the donor
too. Then, as each style rule arrives, encode it as a build assertion instead of applying it by hand, and
prove the assertion by deliberately breaking it.

**Judgment calls — what was NOT done, and why.**
- Did not hand-write twelve copies of a 450-line token block. Duplication is how "byte-identical" quietly
  becomes false three edits later.
- Did not trust the horizontal-scroll check. `body{overflow-x:hidden}` converts overflow into silent
  clipping, so a passing scroll check proved nothing; comparing each child against its `.wrap` content box
  found the real bug.
- Did not guess at the rounded-panel table cells from the screenshot. Reading the computed style named the
  colliding class in one query, and a sweep for classes defined in both stylesheets showed it was the only one.
- Did not fix the card-alignment defect by nudging a magic number after each failure. Measuring the actual
  boxes revealed the `min-height` was landing on the wrong element entirely.
- Did not add a "learn more" orange circle to primary CTAs, and did not let orange fill a button or panel,
  even while adding orange everywhere else it was asked for.
- Did not extend the chooser to the new pages. It had already served its purpose, and its embedding method
  is incompatible with cross-page links.

**Reusable rule.** When a brief arrives in pieces, turn each accepted rule into a build-time assertion and
break it once to prove it fires — otherwise rule five silently undoes rule two. And when a symptom is
visual, read the computed style before reading the source; the collision is usually a class name, not logic.

## 2026-09-07 — Live-source audit, brand kit, developer-portal redesign directions

### What changed

**1. Established what actually serves the live site.** `fusionconnectgroup.com` is **not** built from this
repo. Verified by byte-hashing every live page against every local candidate.

- Live host: nginx at `43.135.32.47` (Tencent Cloud range). **Not Vercel**, despite `.vercel/project.json`
  (`prj_bIBO2PVjRM052GwQXYZN0ZxoPCWB`, work team `team_SyKixqrcZUCIGFNYQC13rwVl`) sitting in this repo.
- Live source of truth: `~/Library/CloudStorage/OneDrive-SharedLibraries-FusionConnectGroup/FCG Marketing - Documents/07 Website/`.
  Every live page matches a file there byte-for-byte, except that the deployer stripped the space out of
  the `* _crystal-denzel-edit.html` filenames and rewrote the `%20` hrefs. Uploaded 20 July 2026.
- Only `components.html` in this repo matches live. Everything else is a stale May-2026 "Full Website V8"
  generation: `4.3M+` / `300+ partners` / US spelling, and pages (`whitelabel`, `advisory-implementation`,
  `api-access`, `ai-mapping`, `agent-booking-tool`) that were never live.
- **nginx serves the homepage as a catch-all for unknown paths**, so a 200 does not prove a page exists.
  Compare bytes, never status codes.

**2. Built the FCG brand kit** → [brandkit/](brandkit). `designlang` v12.15.0 full extraction plus a written
spec, with every token cross-checked against the live page's own inline `<style>` block.

**3. Built two developer-portal homepage directions** → [open-portal-redesign/](open-portal-redesign),
realigning `open.fusionconnectgroup.com/home` to the marketing brand. Direction A via `huashu-design`,
Direction B via `impeccable`, both assembled into a self-contained tabbed chooser.

### Decisions

- **The brand kit's authority is the live HTML, not designlang.** designlang's heuristics rank CSS
  frequency, not brand intent. It was right that Inter carries everything (Sora is loaded in the live
  `<head>` and never applied — do not reintroduce it), but its `foreground: #000000` and "Title Case"
  voice call both contradict the source (`#0F1114`; sentence case with a terminal full stop).
- **The accent rule is the whole system.** `#F97316` appears 49 times against ink's 188 and is never a
  surface — only status dots, section-eyebrow dashes, statistic unit suffixes, thin arcs, focus rings.
  The current portal breaks this with orange button and panel fills; both directions fix it.
- **Raster brand boards deliberately not faked.** The `brandkit` skill is image generation and every
  model refused on quota. Built the board in code from the real tokens and the real wordmark instead —
  more accurate than a model's approximation, and editable. Prompts stored for later.
- **Did not polish the losing variant.** Two known cosmetic defects in Direction A (faint partner-grid
  crosshairs, orange arcs spilling outside the globe) are logged, not fixed, until a direction is chosen.

### Blockers

- **Image generation: BLOCKED.** Both Google AI Studio keys in 1Password return
  `429 … free_tier_requests, limit: 0` for every Gemini image model — no billing on either project.
  Higgsfield returns `Not authenticated` and needs an interactive `hf auth login` from Crystal.
- **Open question for Crystal — small orange text.** `#F97316` on white is 2.80:1 and fails AA; it is one
  of the three contrast failures designlang flagged on the live site. Both directions independently set
  the eyebrow label in ink and kept only the dash orange. Recommended resolution: `#C2410C` (4.6:1) for
  small orange text, `#F97316` retained at display size. Awaiting her call.
- **External publication not done.** The chooser is local only; hosting it publicly needs her approval.
- **`brandkit` skill is not session-registered.** It lives at `Desktop/Claude/.claude/skills/brandkit`,
  one level above this project, so `Skill(brandkit)` fails with "Unknown skill". Read and followed the
  SKILL.md directly. Its `.agents/skills/brandkit` twin is byte-identical.

### Next actions

1. Crystal picks Direction A or B from [open-portal-redesign/choose.html](open-portal-redesign/choose.html).
2. Apply the small-orange-text decision to the chosen direction.
3. Build the remaining portal pages in the chosen direction: `/home/app-management`,
   `/home/api-docs/detail/hotel` (+ `/apis`, `/integration/process`), `/home/api-docs/detail/flink`,
   `/home/api-docs/errors`, `/home/sdk-assistant`, `/home/skills`, `/home/ai-assistant`, `/login`, `/register`.
4. Decide what to do about this repo being stale — reconcile the live OneDrive generation in as the new
   baseline, or retire the repo as a historical checkpoint.
5. Six duplicate full-tree copies (`about/`, `whitelabel/`, `atlas/`, `agreeease/`,
   `corporate-booking-tool/`, `advisory-implementation/`) are untracked junk from an earlier copy
   operation. Deleting them needs Crystal's approval; do not commit them.

### Learnings

**Problem.** Work out which of ~150 local HTML files serves a live site, then realign a sibling portal to
that site's design language.

**Approach.** Hash the live bytes against every local candidate before reading a single file — identity
first, similarity second. When nothing matched, extract the live page's *link graph* rather than its
content: filenames the live homepage referenced (`*_crystal-denzel-edit.html`, `glink`, `addn`) existed
nowhere in the repo or its git history, which located the real source in one Spotlight query. For the
design language, treat the live page's own inline `<style>` block as authority and the extraction tool as
a corroborating witness.

**Judgment calls — what was NOT done, and why.**
- Did not trust `designlang`'s token report, and did not discard it either. Used it for screenshots,
  scale measurement and structure; overrode it on foreground colour and voice where the source disagreed.
- Did not probe live pages by status code. nginx's catch-all returns 200 for everything, so
  `whitelabel.html` and `api-access.html` both looked real at 164,654 bytes — the homepage.
- Did not generate the raster brand boards with a fallback model or a stock stand-in. A board with an
  invented wordmark would have been worse than no board and would have propagated into the redesign.
- Did not accept either subagent's self-report. Direction B's accent check was a false pass on method —
  it grepped the literal hex, missing `var(--accent)`. The conclusion happened to hold; the method
  would not have caught a violation.
- Did not fix the losing variant's cosmetic defects. Polish before selection is work thrown away.

**Reusable rule.** For "which file is live", compare bytes and follow the live page's own link graph —
never filenames, mtimes, or HTTP status codes. For "match this design", the target's own stylesheet
outranks any extraction tool, and the tool's job is screenshots and measurement.
